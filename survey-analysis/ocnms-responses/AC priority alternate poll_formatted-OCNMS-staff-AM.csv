,Treaty Trust Responsibility (1),"The Sanctuary's relationship with federally recognized tribes is unique within NOAA’s Office of National Marine Sanctuaries. Tribal treaties along with associated federal statutes, Executive Orders, and court rulings have established a unique legal relationship, an overarching federal trust responsibility of the United States to Indian tribes. This trust responsibility establishes legal obligations of the United States to Indian tribes, including the protection of treaty fishing rights. The trust responsibility of the Sanctuary to the Makah, Quileute, and Hoh tribes and Quinault Indian Nation is articulated in several judicial decisions, OCNMS regulations and in Executive Order 13175 of November 6, 2000, Consultation and Coordination With Indian Tribal Governments. NOAA's Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary recognizes the preexisting treaty rights of the Hoh, Makah, and Quileute tribes, and the Quinault Indian Nation, and supports the active exercise of those rights.
